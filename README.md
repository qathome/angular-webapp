# Setup

1. Create an account to manage your queue on [QatHome] (http://www.qathome.com/accounts/signup/manager)
2. Follow instructions to validate your email and create your firm, until you reach the help page in the queue manager interface
3. Login with your user (http://www.qathome.com/)
4. Create your application on http://www.qathome.com/developer/applications/ (link is available only AFTER LOGIN)
5. QatHome follows the [OAuth 2.0] (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) standard so feel free to choose what you need (Use for example "Client type" = "Public", "Authorization grant type" = "Resource owner password-based", nothing into "redirect uris")
6. Go to project folder and edit `static/src/config.js`:
    ```
    var QATHOME_CLIENT_CONFIG = {
        server: 'http://qathome.com',
        client_id: 'CLIENT_ID',
        client_secret: 'CLIENT_SECRET',
        username: 'USERNAME',
        password: 'PASSWORD',
        firm_id: 'FIRM_ID'
    };
    ```
    * replace string CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET with your QatHome application client_id and client_secret 
    * replace string USERNAME and PASSWORD with your QatHome account email and password
    * replace string FIRM_ID with your firm id that you can find in the url after login in the queue manager interface. For example: if the url is qathome.com/app/firms/45cbde9e-0dd1-34c4-bf4a-acf92eaf1706/desks/1 then the firm id is 45cbde9e-0dd1-34c4-bf4a-acf92eaf1706
